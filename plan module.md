### Identify Risks
Identify at least two risks that you feel will make it difficult to succeed in this module.  Identify an action plan to overcome each of these risks.

#### Risk 1
I'm behind or at least on the back foot for other school work and I still want to do week 2's project and our team assignment needs work done on it too. I'm going to be pressed for time and tempted to push this off again 'til Friday

##### Action Plan
Try to get it all done on Wednesday so that I have time to fail and still get it in on time

#### Risk 2
Not realizing how hard my plans are until I'm already fairly committed.

##### Action Plan
I need to start working on this early even if I break for a long time. If some kind of information is in my head then I can ponder on that in the down time, and if I work on it early I can see the difficulties and know if I need to pivot or come up with solutions in the down time.
