# Overview

This game is my first delv into the arcade game frame work. I am trying to make the game Stratigo, but haven't given it enough time to be anywhere near complete

I wanted to learn arcade, practice game development, and practice my Python. It's been a while since I used python.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the game being played and a walkthrough of the code.}
